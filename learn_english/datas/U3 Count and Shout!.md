18. Jonny Bear Helps His Mother.
Early one morning, the sky is blue. All the little bears are playing. 
Jonny is looking around for his brother and sister.

” There you are, Sister!” he says. ” I can see your hand and fingers!”
” And there you are, Brother! I can see your cap and
your feet! Now it's your turn to look for me!”

” But where are you, Jonny?” says Brother.
” Keep looking,” says Sister. Then he points at Jonny.
” Oh, I see your bottom!”

Mother Bear opens the door.
” Come here, little bears,” she says. ” I want you to help me. Go and get your clothes. We are going to wash them. 
Then you will have clean clothes to wear.”
” Yes, Mother” they said. They all run in and close the door.

The three little bears take their clothes to Mother Bear.
” Did you take the things out of your pockets?” Mother says. ” Yes, we did.”

” Now, little bears, put on your shoes,” says Mother Bear. ” Go out and put these clothes on the line.
Then we will make something very nice to eat.”

The three little bears march out. ” We can do this fast,”
says Brother. They sing a song and put shirts, shorts, and pants on the line.

Jonny is too short. He cannot touch the line.
” Sister, I cannot put this sweater up there. Can you help me? Your legs and arms are long!”
” Yes, I will help you,” says Sister. She pats his little head.

Back in the house, Mother Bear is happy with her little bears. ” Thank you for helping me,” she says.
” You are welcome, Mother. Can we put faces on these?” ” Yes, you can.”

The three little bears have some fun! They make big
eyes and small eyes. They make short ears and long ears. Sister puts red cheeks and lips on her face.

Now it's time to go to bed. Jonny is sleepy.
He rubs his eyes and brushes his teeth. Brother washes his face with water. Sister uses a comb to comb her hair.

” In the morning,” says Mother Bear,” we will go swimming. 
We will take food and many fish. M.r Sam and Miss Susie will go with us. It will be a good day!”
